In this project I have classify sports atheletes from different sports with the help of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). We restrict the classification to only five players.

1) Leonel Messi
2) Sachin Tendulkar
3) Roger Federer
4) Tiger Woods
5) Lebron James

Here is the folder structure:

1) UI : This contains ui website code
2) server: Python flask server
3) model: Contains python notebook for model building
4) test_samples: This contains the sample images to check whether our model is predicting correctly or not.

Technologies Used:

1) Python
2) Augmentor for expanding the training dataset.
3) Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
4) Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
5) Tensorflow and Keras for model building
6) Google colab and pycharm as IDE
7) Python flask for http server
8) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
